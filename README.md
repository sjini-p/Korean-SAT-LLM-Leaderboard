------
Take advantage of this unique opportunity to compare human academic ability with the performance of large language
models (LLMs) based on the highly reputable College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT)!

Test how well your fine-tuned Korean LLM performs on a 10-year benchmark of the Korean CSAT and see what score it would
achieve right now!

cf) To prevent data leakage, this benchmark only includes models released before each year's CSAT (Suneung) on the
leaderboard.

### 🚨 Notice: 2025 SAT (1-Year) Model Performance Comparison Results

The current benchmark has been completed using GPT-based models. Future performance evaluations for other models will be
conducted as additional resources and funding become available.  
Please note that the current grade thresholds are **estimated**, and they will be updated once the official thresholds
are announced.

The incorrectly answered question on the o1-preview was question 8 (3 points) from the CSAT Korean section, a
non-literary text question!

## 🎯 What is the Korean SAT LLM Leaderboard?

The Korean SAT LLM leaderboard is a leaderboard benchmarking 10 years of Korean CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test)
exams, developed by the reputable KICE (Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation).  
The CSAT consists of a wide range of question types depending on the difficulty level, designed to assess reading
comprehension, critical thinking, and sentence interpretation skills.

## 🪑 Benchmark Dataset

- This competition utilizes CSAT Korean questions from the 10-year period between 2015 and 2024.
- For the elective subjects introduced in 2022, **Speech and Composition** will be used as the elective subject for
  benchmarking.
- The key evaluation metrics for the benchmark dataset include: **Language Comprehension**, **Core Content Understanding
  **, **Logical Reasoning**, **Critical Thinking**, **Creative Thinking**, and **Multimedia Interpretation Skills**.
  <Source: 2024 KICE CSAT Korean Evaluation Criteria>
- The comprehension of LLMs can be assessed by examining their performance on problems from various fields such as
  humanities, social sciences, science, technology, and the arts.

## 📑 Category of Benchmark Dataset

### (1) 📚 Reading Comprehension

Content: Passages are drawn from a wide range of fields, including humanities, social sciences, science, technology, and
the arts.

- **Humanities passages**: Cover topics such as philosophy, argumentation, and history.
- **Social sciences passages**: Focus on subjects like economics, politics, law, and culture.
- **Science passages**: Include content related to physics, chemistry, biology, and earth sciences.
- **Technology passages**: Feature topics like computers, machinery, and everyday science.
- **Arts passages**: Encompass a variety of artistic themes, including visual arts, music, architecture, and film.
- **Integrated passages**: Complex, long passages that combine multiple fields are also frequently included.

- **Evaluation focus**: Assessment of understanding across diverse domains, evaluation of reasoning and critical
  thinking skills.

### (2) 🧑‍🎤 Literature

Content: Covers a variety of literary genres such as classical and modern novels, classical and modern poetry, and
classical essays.

- **Evaluation focus**: Assessment of emotional and stylistic comprehension, evaluation of understanding of various
  literary periods and genres.

### (3) 🗣️ Speech and Writing

Content: Includes problems dealing with dialogue and writing.

- **Evaluation focus**: Assessment of understanding in conversational contexts and evaluation of writing skills.

## ♾️ Metric

### Evaluation Method

- In this competition, the answers submitted by each model are evaluated based on whether they match the actual correct
  answers.
- Scores are graded for each year's questions, and the final ranking is determined by the **average of the standardized
  scores**.

### Explanation of Leaderboard Score

- **Raw Score**: The score achieved out of a maximum of 100 points on the test.
- **Standardized Score**: A score that measures how far the test taker's raw score deviates from the average.
- **Grade**: Based on standardized scores, test takers are classified into 9 grades. For the Korean, Math, and Inquiry
  subjects, the top 4% of all test takers receive a grade of 1, the next 7% (cumulative 11%) receive a grade of 2, and
  the next 12% (cumulative 23%) receive a grade of 3.

## 🤷 More About CSAT(Korean college entrance exam)

The Korean CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test) Korean Language section is a university entrance exam,
with questions meticulously selected by renowned scholars from KICE (Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation),
who are confined to a hotel for this process. It is one of the most reputable exams in Korea. Evaluating the performance
of LLMs (Large Language Models) based on the metrics used to assess test-takers provides an excellent opportunity to
compare human proficiency with the language capabilities of LLMs.

## 📰 Notice

- Due to copyright concerns, the CSAT benchmark dataset will not be made publicly available. The evaluation data spans
  from the **2015 CSAT to the 2024 CSAT**, and elective subjects for the years 2022 to 2024 will be limited to **Speech
  and Composition**.
- To ensure fairness, the prompts will not be disclosed.
- In the future, the leaderboard will be updated to reflect models submitted for all subjects, including Korean,
  English, Math, Science, and Social Studies, on the day of the CSAT.
- This Korean-SAT benchmarking system powered by [AutoRAG](https://github.com/Marker-Inc-Korea/AutoRAG). AutoRAG is
  awesome!!
  (AutoRAG is an automatic RAG optimization tool that can also be used for LLM performance comparison and prompt
  engineering.)
  Since the implementation of elective subjects in 2022, the standard score formula has been derived using
  the [Crux Table](https://suneungcalc.com/) provided by [Crux Consulting](https://orbi.kr/profile/974081).
